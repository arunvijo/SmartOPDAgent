## 📌 Project Overview

SmartOPDAgent is an intelligent **multi-agent AI chatbot system** designed to streamline hospital OPD (Outpatient Department) visits. The system uses two specialized AI agents, coordinated by a central agent, to:

- Book doctor-specific appointments
- Recommend the most suitable doctors based on symptoms
- Guide patients in real-time (traffic updates, crowd data, reminders)

This project addresses the core challenges in outpatient services, such as long wait times, patient confusion, and lack of personalized care — especially in public healthcare systems.

## 🤖 Agents Overview

### 🔹 Main Agent (Router)
- First point of interaction.
- Detects patient intent:
  - If patient mentions a specific doctor → forwards to **Agent 1**
  - If patient describes symptoms/issues → forwards to **Agent 2**

---

### 🔹 Agent 1 – Booking & Patient Tracker
- **Checks doctor’s appointment slots**
- **Books available slots**
- Tracks patient journey with:
  - 🧑‍⚕️ OPD crowd estimation
  - 🚦 Real-time traffic via API
  - 📩 Automated reminders/notifications (SMS/WhatsApp)
- Guides patient till hospital arrival

---

### 🔹 Agent 2 – Symptom-Based Doctor Recommender
- Uses **vectorized feedback database**
- Matches patient's issue with real patient experiences
- Recommends the most **suitable and available doctor**
- Ensures **equal opportunity** by balancing between senior/junior doctors
- After confirmation, routes back to **Agent 1** for booking
